Thank you so much for the opportunity to complete this activity. I used the VueJS framework with bootstrap. 

I ran into one bug with the Clover API. For some reason, 'stockCount: 0, itemStock: null' appears in all 'items' GET requests (e.g. https://apisandbox.dev.clover.com/v3/merchants/5JR8C0AKERFHG/items/36EVK203TEFX6?access_token=547e386a-6c78-aa08-bc21-3a3a771d2eb4&return_null_fields=true), but the correct stockCount appears in when 'itemStocks' is requested (e.g. https://apisandbox.dev.clover.com/v3/merchants/5JR8C0AKERFHG/item_stocks/36EVK203TEFX6?access_token=547e386a-6c78-aa08-bc21-3a3a771d2eb4&return_null_fields=true). While I was able to combine items and itemStocks to work functionally, this slowed me down enought that I was unable to complete styling to match the guide. 

I truly enjoyed completing this challenge, and I look forward to hearing from you regarding the next steps in the interview process!

Best,

Jody
